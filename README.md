<h1 align="center">tuterm-collection</h1>

This is a collection of [tuterm](https://github.com/harisgusic/tuterm) scripts for commonly used CLI programs. It is still under construction.

In order to run a tutorial, run the following:
```shell
tuterm ./SCRIPT_NAME
```
or just
```shell
./SCRIPT_NAME
```

So, in order to run the `git` tutorial, you have to run
```shell
./git
```

Feel free to contribute more tutorials :)
