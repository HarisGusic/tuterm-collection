In the stump of the old tree,

in the stumps of old trees with rotten hearts,
where the rain gathers and the laced leaves and the dead bird like a trap,
there are holes the length of a man's arm,
and in every crevice of the rotten wood grow weasel's eyes like molluscs,
their lids open and shut with the tide. But do not put your hand down to see,
because
in the stumps of old trees where the hearts have rotted out there are holes the length of a man's arm where the weasels
are trapped and the letters of the rook language are laced on the sodden leaves,
and at the bottom there is a man's arm.

in the stumps of old trees where the hearts have rotted out there are deep holes and dank pools where the rain gathers,

you can wipe it in the sharp grass till it bleeds,

    m "Grep utility is a powerful file processing tool used to find patterns in text files."
    M "We created a new directory named dir for you convenience, it will be removed automatically after you finish this tutorial."
    M "Let's search any line that contains the substring 'he stump' in ./dir/p1/p1.txt"
    M 'Repeat after me:'
    c grep \"he stump\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt
    M "As we can see, the previous command matched the substring ignoring word boundaries."
    M "However, we can add this constraint with flag -w"
    c grep -w \"he stump\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt
    M "Grep supports searching by regular expressions, which is more flexible than finding substrings or words."
    M "Let's find all lines beginning with 'and'."
    c grep  \"^and\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt
    M "Let's find all lines ending with 'use'."
    c grep  \"use$\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt

    c grep  \"and.*like\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt
    M "Now, when we covered basics of regex, let's explore the most useful flags of grep command."
    M "Flag -n displays the lines containing the pattern along with the line numbers"
    c grep -n \"the stump\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt
    M "Flag -i allows to perform a case-insensitive search"

    c grep -c \"and\" ./dir/p1/p1.txt
